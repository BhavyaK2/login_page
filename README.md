### What is the point of this project?

Its one part webapp testing ground, one part collaborative art project

### How is this useful for webapp testing?

This isn't meant to replicate a single, cohesive production environment. It's also not necessarily supposed to be constructed with best practices for performance, efficiency, and even security.

Think of it as a chimera - a collection of code snippets, exercises, and behaviors mashed together in an incoherentl but hopefully interesting way. A Login page may not actually log you into anything, but that's not necessarily the point.
